          <!-- <p class="lead">Joan Clarke was an English cryptanalyst who worked alongside Alan Turing during World War II</p> -->
          <p>Joan Clarke was an English cryptanalyst who worked alongside Alan Turing during World War II. A gifted mathematician, Clarke quickly distinguished herself and rose through the ranks to become one of the best code-breakers at Bletchley Park - despite the era's pronounced discrimation towards women.</p>
          <p>After the war, she became a renowned expert in Numismatics, the study of currency, and went on to publish multiple papers that were regarded as authoritative on the subject.</p>
          <p>Given Clarke's historical role, as well as her fascination with coins and currency, ClarkeCoin proved to be the perfect name for the Turing School of Software and Designâ€™s own in-house cryptocurrency, and serves as a fitting tribute to such an important female figure in Cryptanalysis.</p>
